Given a binary tree A with N nodes.

You have to remove all the half nodes and return the final binary tree.

NOTE:

Half nodes are nodes which have only one child.
Leaves should not be touched as they have both children as NULL.


Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 105



Input Format
First and only argument is an pointer to the root of binary tree A.



Output Format
Return a pointer to the root of the new binary tree.



Example Input
Input 1:

           1
         /   \
        2     3
       / 
      4

Input 2:

            1
          /   \
         2     3
        / \     \
       4   5     6


Example Output
Output 1:

           1
         /   \
        4     3
Output 2:

            1
          /   \
         2     6
        / \

       4   5




Solution:



/**
 * Definition for binary tree
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
TreeNode* Solution::solve(TreeNode* A) {
    if(A->left == NULL && A->right == NULL)return A;
    if(A->left == NULL)
        return solve(A->right);
    if(A->right == NULL)
        return solve(A->left);
    A->left = solve(A->left);
    A->right = solve(A->right);
    return A;
    
}
