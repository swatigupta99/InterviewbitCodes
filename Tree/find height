Given a generic tree, find and return the height of given tree.
Input format :

Elements in level order form separated by space (as per done in class). Order is - 
Root_data, n (No_Of_Child_Of_Root), n children, and so on for every element 

Output Format :

Height

Sample Input :

10 3 20 30 40 2 40 50 0 0 0 0 

Sample Output :

3

Solution:

int height(TreeNode<int>* root) {
    /* Don't write main().
     * Don't read input, it is passed as function argument.
     * Return output and don't print it.
     * Taking input and printing output is handled automatically.
     */

    int h = 0;
    
    if(root == NULL) {
        return h;
    }
    
    for(int i = 0; i < root -> children.size(); i++) {
        h = max(h, height(root -> children[i]));
    }
    
    return h + 1;
}
