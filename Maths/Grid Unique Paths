A robot is located at the top-left corner of an A x B grid (marked â€˜Startâ€™ in the diagram below).

Path Sum: Example 1

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked â€˜Finishâ€™ in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

Note: A and B will be such that the resulting answer fits in a 32 bit signed integer.

Example :

Input : A = 2, B = 2
Output : 2

2 possible routes : (0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (1, 1) 
              OR  : (0, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (1, 1)
              

Solution:


int Solution::uniquePaths(int A, int B) {
    long long m=A-1,n=B-1,k=min(m,n),num=1,den=1;
    n=m+n;
    
    for(;k>0; k--,n--)
    {
        num*=n;
        den*=k;
        if(num%den==0)
        {
            num/=den;
            den=1;
        }
    }
    return (int)num;
}
