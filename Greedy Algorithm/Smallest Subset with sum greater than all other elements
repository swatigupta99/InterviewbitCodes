Given an array of non-negative integers. Our task is to find minimum number of elements such that their sum should be greater than the sum of rest of the elements of the array.
Examples : 
 

Input : arr[] = {3, 1, 7, 1}
Output : 1
Smallest subset is {7}. Sum of
this subset is greater than all
other elements {3, 1, 1}

Input : arr[] = {2, 1, 2}
Output : 2
In this example one element is not 
enough. We can pick elements with 
values 1, 2 or 2, 2. In any case, 
the minimum count is 2



Solution:
int minElements(int arr[], int n)
{
  int sum = 0 , halfsum = 0 , res=0 ;
  for(int i=0 ; i<n ;i++)
  { 
    sum += arr[i];
  }
  halfsum = sum/2;
  sort(arr , arr+n);
  int curr=0;
  for(int i = n-1 ; i>0; i--)
  {
    curr += arr[i];
    res++;
    if (curr >= halfsum)
    {
      return res;
    }
    return res;
  }
