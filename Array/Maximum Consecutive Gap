Given an unsorted array, find the maximum difference between the successive elements in its sorted form.

Try to solve it in linear time/space.

Example :

Input : [1, 10, 5]
Output : 5 
Return 0 if the array contains less than 2 elements.

You may assume that all the elements in the array are non-negative integers and fit in the 32-bit signed integer range.
You may also assume that the difference will not overflow.


Solution:

int Solution::maximumGap(const vector<int> &A) {
    vector<int>v=A;
    sort (v.begin(),v.end());
    int i,diff=0,mad=0 ;
    if (v.size()==1)
    {
        return 0;
    }
    for (i=0;i<v.size()-1;i++)
    {
       diff = v[i+1] - v[i];
       if(diff > mad)
       {
           mad = diff;
       }
      
    }
    return mad;
}
